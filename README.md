The troubling state of ***continuous increase in health care premiums*** in the United States has drawn policymakers, business leaders, and health experts to search for viable ways to reform the health care system.
The United States can learn from other countries because, from popular culture to technology, modern life testifies to the ways ideas and practices flow across borders. People who face the same difficulties, for the same reasons, can count on some of the same responses to help. Thus, the search for solutions has become global in scope, as the United States looks beyond its borders to examine how other industrialized nations provide and finance health care. Such lessons from abroad are possible by ***cross-national comparisons and analyses of the extensive comparative data and information available***.

There is not an exact cause for increase in health care premiums in United States as they have morphed through the years. Some of them have been cost of new technologies, chronic diseases and high administrative costs. ***We hope to analyze the major contributing factors in this increase***. 

Health care in the United States is offered mostly through the private sector while in Canada it is administered through a provincial government system. ***By comparing the U.S. health care system with Canada’s health care system, we hope to discover ways in which the U.S. might adapt to strengthen its’s own health care system***.
